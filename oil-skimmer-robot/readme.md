# Project: Robotic System for the Identification, Containment and Removal of Oil and Hydrocarbons to Mitigate the Environmental Impact of Fishing Activities

The following reposityory recopilates the files related to this project.

## Summary

The main problem is the inefficient response to identify, contain, and remove hydrocarbons spilled into the sea that have a negative impact on the ecosystem and fishing activities. The main causes are: modern methods of high operating cost, traditional methods that involve people in risky activities, spill areas are difficult to access, and there are no quick response solutions in the fishing ecosystem. The negative impacts are the contamination of the marine ecosystem, and the cessation of fishing activities for long periods of time.

In this project, we propose the validation and adaptation of a robotic system for the identification, containment, and removal of hydrocarbons to mitigate the negative environmental impact in fishing activities, and the methodology of use of the integrated system. The solution will allow the identification, containment, and removal of hydrocarbons spilled into the sea in an economical, safe, and fast way. The capacity to respond to environmental disasters will be improved, and the market for specialized services for the value chain will be strengthened.

## Impact

- Minimize and mitigate environmental impacts in the sea.
- Modernize and strengthen specialized services for fishing.
- Guarantee the sustainability of economic fishing activities.
Impacts aligned with sustainable development goals:
- SDG 4, increase the number of young people with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) skills.
- SDG 9, promote the technological capacity of the industry in developing countries.
- SDG 14, develop marine research and technology to improve the health of the oceans.
- SDG 17, strengthen alliances for sustainable development in the public and private spheres.
